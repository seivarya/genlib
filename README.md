<h2 align="center">genlib</h2>

A general purpose C library containing reusable data structures and utilities.

This repository is a work in progress and is expected to grow over time.  
The goal is to collect well structured, standalone components that can be reused across multiple C projects without pulling in unnecessary dependencies.

The library is intentionally kept modular, so individual components can be copied or included as needed.

Build instructions, detailed documentation, and usage examples will be added gradually as the project evolves.
